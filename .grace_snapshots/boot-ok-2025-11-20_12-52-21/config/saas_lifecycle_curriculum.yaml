  3. DEVELOPMENT → Frontend, backend, API, integrations
  4. AI INTEGRATION → LLMs, ML models, automation
  5. SECURITY → Authentication, authorization, encryption, pentesting
  6. BLOCKCHAIN → Smart contracts, Web3, DeFi features
  7. DEPLOYMENT → Cloud hosting, CI/CD, containers
  8. MONITORING → Observability, analytics, logging
  9. SCALING → Load balancing, caching, optimization
  10. MAINTENANCE → Updates, patches, support
