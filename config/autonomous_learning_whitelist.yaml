# Grace Autonomous Learning Whitelist
# Defines domains Grace can autonomously study, practice, and master
# Focus: Learning by building, not just reading

# Core Philosophy:
# - Use sandbox to test edge cases
# - Build real projects to apply knowledge
# - Work from KPIs and trust scores
# - NO chatbot mode - real engineering only
# - Follow whitelist strictly for autonomous work
