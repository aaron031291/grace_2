## 🔧 TO MAKE OPERATIONAL

**Simple fixes needed:**

1. **Fix remaining `metadata` columns** (rename to `meta_data`)
   - In: code_memory.py (line 103)
   - Quick search/replace

2. **Initialize databases**
   ```bash
   py -m backend.models  # Create tables
   py -m backend.seed_governance_policies
   py -m backend.seed_hunter_rules
   py -m backend.seed_parliament
   ```

3. **Start backend**
   ```bash
   py backend/main.py
   ```

4. **Test via API**
   ```bash
   POST /api/transcendence/learn
   ```

**Effort:** 30 minutes to fix + test
