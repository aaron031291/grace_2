## 🎯 Milestones

**v0.6 (Week 3)** - Integration Complete  
**v0.7 (Week 5)** - ML/DL Working  
**v0.8 (Week 7)** - Meta-Loops Active  
**v0.9 (Week 9)** - Production Ready  
**v1.0 (Week 10)** - Public Release  

## 📊 Completion Estimate

**Current:** 80% of features built  
**Remaining:** 20% integration + testing + polish  
**Timeline:** 10 weeks to v1.0  
**Confidence:** High (solid foundation)

## 🚀 Post-v1.0 Vision

### v1.1 - Vector Search
- Semantic memory
- Embedding-based knowledge retrieval
- Similar code detection

### v1.2 - Multi-User
- Team collaboration
- Shared knowledge bases
- User permissions

### v1.3 - LLM Integration
- GPT/Claude for complex reasoning
- Still trust-scored and verified
- Hybrid local + cloud

### v2.0 - Self-Architecture
- Level 3 meta-loops
- Code self-modification
- Autonomous evolution

## ✅ Realistic Assessment

**Grace is:**
- Real and functional ✅
- Production-quality architecture ✅
- 80% feature complete ✅
- Well-tested core ✅

**Grace needs:**
- Frontend verification (1-2 weeks)
- Integration polish (1-2 weeks)
- Production hardening (2-3 weeks)
- ML implementation (2-3 weeks)

**Total to v1.0:** 10 weeks of focused work

**This is achievable and realistic.** The foundation is excellent. 🚀
