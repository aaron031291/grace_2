## 🗣️ Demo Script

"Grace represents a new approach to AI: complete honesty, cryptographic verification, and autonomous operation within governed boundaries.

Unlike traditional AI:
- Grace admits when she doesn't know something
- All knowledge sources are trust-scored
- Every action is cryptographically signed
- Complete audit trail proves everything

Grace can:
- Learn from verified sources
- Execute code safely
- Heal herself when components fail
- Optimize her own performance
- Propose research when lacking knowledge

All while maintaining complete security, governance, and auditability.

This is the future of trustworthy autonomous AI."
