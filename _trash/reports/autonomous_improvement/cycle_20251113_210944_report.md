## Grace's Reasoning

I analyzed recent research, identified potential improvements, tested them in sandbox,
and created proposals for the most promising ones. Each proposal includes:

- Sandbox test results
- KPI measurements
- Trust score (0-100)
- Risk assessment
- Expected improvements

**Awaiting human consensus for deployment approval.**
