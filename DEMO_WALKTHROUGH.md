# Grace Memory Studio - Complete Demo Walkthrough

## 🚀 Welcome to Grace Memory Studio

Experience the complete autonomous knowledge ingestion and self-healing workflow. This guide walks you through the full Grace system: from book upload through ingestion, self-healing, and intelligent quizzing.

## 📋 Demo Steps

### 1. **Upload a Book** 📚
- **What happens**: Drop a PDF or EPUB file into the ingestion area
- **Grace responds**: Librarian automatically detects and begins processing
- **UI feedback**: Progress bar shows ingestion status, schema proposals appear

### 2. **Librarian Processing** 🤖
- **What happens**: Librarian analyzes file metadata and content structure
- **Grace responds**: Extracts chapters, creates knowledge chunks, builds memory index
- **UI feedback**: Real-time processing updates, trust score calculations

### 3. **Schema Review** ✅
- **What happens**: Review automatically generated schema for content
- **Grace responds**: Proposes optimal data structure for the book
- **UI feedback**: Schema approval modal with preview and validation

### 4. **Content Ingestion** 📥
- **What happens**: Full content processing and memory storage
- **Grace responds**: Creates searchable knowledge base with relationships
- **UI feedback**: Ingestion completion, memory workspace populated

### 5. **Verification & Trust** 🔍
- **What happens**: Verification kernel checks content integrity
- **Grace responds**: Calculates trust scores, validates knowledge accuracy
- **UI feedback**: Trust metrics displayed, verification badges

### 6. **Self-Healing Demo** ⚕️
- **What happens**: Trigger simulated failure to see self-healing
- **Grace responds**: Automatically executes remediation playbook
- **UI feedback**: Self-healing dashboard shows real-time recovery

### 7. **Co-Pilot Interaction** 💬
- **What happens**: Ask questions about ingested content
- **Grace responds**: Provides intelligent summaries and insights
- **UI feedback**: Contextual responses, follow-up suggestions

### 8. **Knowledge Assessment** 🧠
- **What happens**: AI-generated flashcards and quizzes
- **Grace responds**: Tests understanding, provides feedback
- **UI feedback**: Performance tracking, learning recommendations
