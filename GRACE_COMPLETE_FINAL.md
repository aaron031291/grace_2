## 📊 Repository Organization

**Before:** 400+ mixed files, chaotic structure  
**After:** Professional organization

```
grace_2/
├── serve.py (main entry)
├── README.md (documentation)
├── backend/ (70+ subdirectories, only requirements.txt in root)
├── docs/ (25+ subdirectories, organized by type)
├── scripts/ (4 subdirectories: startup, test, deployment, utilities)
├── tests/ (3 subdirectories: e2e, stress, unit)
└── logs/ (organized by test type)
```

**Improvement:**
- Root: 47 → 8 files (83% cleaner)
- Backend: 180 → 1 file in root (99% organized)
- Total: 400+ files categorized

## 🎯 Complete W's Coverage

| Question | Layer | Component | Storage |
|----------|-------|-----------|---------|
| **WHY** | L3 - Brain | Intent Model | task_contexts.why_json |
| **WHAT** | L2 - HTM | Task Details | task_contexts.what_json |
| **WHERE** | L1 - Exec | Source/Dest | provenance.source_chain |
| **WHEN** | L2 - HTM | SLA Manager | sla_history |
| **WHO** | L2 - HTM | Agent Mgmt | agent_ownership |
| **HOW** | L1 - Exec | Workflows | task_contexts.how_json |

**All questions answered with full traceability!** ✅

## 🔄 Autonomous Loops

**1. Learning Loop:**
```
Execute → Telemetry → Learn → Adjust Intent → Execute
```

**2. Self-Healing Loop:**
```
Detect → Trigger → Playbook → Verify → Learn
```

**3. Intent Loop:**
```
Goal → Task → Orchestrate → Execute → Evaluate → Refine Goal
```

**All loops closed and operational!** ✅
