How to Feed Grace This Knowledge

    Curated Books & Courses
        Clone or ingest specific sources into Memory Fusion (e.g., “Designing Data-Intensive Applications,” “Kubernetes Up & Running,” “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow,” “SRE Book,” “Cloud Security Engineering”).

    Industry Docs & RFCs
        REST + gRPC specs, OAuth specs, cloud provider architecture blueprints, AWS Well-Architected Framework.

    Open Repos & Papers
        GitHub orgs (tensorflow, pytorch, kubernetes, istio), ML research (arXiv, Papers With Code), standard architecture blog posts (Uber, Netflix, Google SRE).

    Playbooks & Runbooks
        On-call manuals, self-healing playbooks, runbook automation recipes (already supported via the ingestion pipeline).

    Public API directories
        Verified via Hunter Bridge and the verification matrix (OpenAI, TensorFlow Hub, Hugging Face, ML Model Zoo, Kaggle, Google AI Platform).

Suggested Path (Practical)

    Phase 1: Programming, data engineering, cloud/Kubernetes, DevOps/SRE, security.
    Phase 2: ML/DL, data science, enterprise architecture, product/growth/CS.
    Phase 3: Blockchain, edge/IoT, quantum, advanced research topics.
    Always: Legal/compliance, AI ethics, business finance, operations.

Keep a knowledge ingestion schedule (weekly or monthly) and let Librarian surface gaps in coverage. As Grace ingests each domain, run library_apply_playbook.py or equivalent scripts to turn the knowledge into actionable playbooks, execution tasks, and co-pilot abilities.
