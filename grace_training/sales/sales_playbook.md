---

### Stage 5: Business Case & Proposal (Days 66-80)

**Objective**: Build compelling business case and formal proposal

**ROI Calculation Template**:

```
Current State Costs:
- Downtime cost: [# incidents/month] × [avg resolution time] × [cost per hour] = $X
- Engineer time on ops: [# engineers] × [% time on ops] × [loaded cost] = $Y
- Compliance prep: [hours/year] × [hourly rate] = $Z

Total Annual Cost: $X + $Y + $Z = $CURRENT

GRACE Investment:
- Annual subscription: $A
- Implementation: $B
- Training: $C

Total Annual Investment: $A + $B + $C = $INVESTMENT

Projected Savings (Conservative):
- Downtime reduction (50%): $X × 0.5 = $X1
- Ops time savings (40%): $Y × 0.4 = $Y1
- Compliance savings (60%): $Z × 0.6 = $Z1

Total Annual Savings: $X1 + $Y1 + $Z1 = $SAVINGS

Net Annual Benefit: $SAVINGS - $INVESTMENT = $NET
ROI: ($NET / $INVESTMENT) × 100 = X%
Payback Period: $INVESTMENT / ($SAVINGS/12) = X months
```

**Proposal Components**:
1. **Executive Summary** (1 page)
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Investment and ROI summary
   - Recommended next steps

2. **Business Case** (2-3 pages)
   - Current state analysis
   - Proposed solution details
   - Financial analysis (ROI, payback period)
   - Risk mitigation

3. **Technical Solution** (3-5 pages)
   - Architecture overview
   - Integration points
   - Security and compliance
   - Implementation timeline

4. **Pricing** (1 page)
   - Tier recommendation with justification
   - Line-item breakdown
   - Payment terms
   - Support options

5. **Implementation Plan** (1-2 pages)
   - Phases and timeline
   - Milestones
   - Resource requirements
   - Success metrics

6. **Case Studies** (Appendix)
   - 2-3 relevant customer success stories

**Pricing Presentation**:

---

### Stage 6: Negotiation & Close (Days 81-95)

**Objective**: Navigate procurement and close the deal

**Common Negotiation Points**:

**1. Price/Discount**
- **Customer ask**: "Can you do 30% off?"
- **Response**: Focus on value and ROI. Offer alternatives:
  - Annual prepay discount (17%)
  - Multi-year commit (20-25%)
  - Start with smaller scope, expand later
- **Approval required**: >15% discount needs VP Sales approval

**2. Contract Terms**
- **Customer ask**: "We need a monthly contract"
- **Response**: Annual minimum, quarterly payment option available
- **Fallback**: 6-month minimum with 30-day termination notice

**3. Service Level Agreement**
- **Customer ask**: "We need 99.99% uptime guarantee"
- **Response**: Available in Enterprise tier. Professional tier is 99.9%
- **Note**: Understand their actual requirements vs. wants

**4. Data Security/Privacy**
- **Customer ask**: "Can data stay in our region?"
- **Response**: Yes, multi-region deployment available (Enterprise tier)
- **Note**: DPA and security addendums standard

**5. Professional Services**
- **Customer ask**: "Implementation should be included"
- **Response**: Standard onboarding included. Custom PS scoped separately
- **Compromise**: Include X hours of PS in year 1

**Negotiation Strategies**:
- ✅ Give to get (trade concessions, don't just give)
- ✅ Anchor on value and ROI
- ✅ Know your walk-away point
- ✅ Get legal/procurement involved early
- ✅ Create urgency (end of quarter, pricing changes)
- ✅ Executive alignment (CXO to CXO)

**Closing Techniques**:
1. **Assumptive close**: "I'll have the contract sent over this week. Who should I address it to?"
2. **Summary close**: Recap all agreed points, natural progression to signature
3. **Deadline close**: "If we can get this signed by month-end, I can include [bonus]"
4. **Champion close**: Leverage internal champion to drive signatures

**Exit Criteria**:
- ✅ Contract signed by all parties
- ✅ Purchase order received
- ✅ Opportunity marked "Closed Won" in Salesforce
- ✅ Customer Success team introduced

## Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "This is too expensive"

**Probe**:
- "Compared to what? What are you using today and what does it cost?"
- "Have you calculated the cost of downtime and manual operations?"

**Response**:
- Reframe to ROI: "The average customer sees 8-month payback period"
- Show cost of inaction: "What's the cost of continuing with current approach?"
- Offer alternatives: "We can start with Professional tier and expand"

**Example**: "I understand budget is a concern. Let's look at the numbers. You mentioned you have 10 engineers spending 30% of their time on incident response. At $200K average salary, that's $600K per year in just labor. GRACE Professional tier at $180K/year could reduce that by 40%, saving you $240K annually. That's a $60K net savings in year one, plus the business value of reduced downtime."

---

### Objection 2: "We already have [monitoring tool / incident management]"

**Probe**:
- "That's great. How is it working for you?"
- "What happens after your monitoring tool detects an issue?"
- "How much manual work is still required?"

**Response**:
- "GRACE complements your monitoring tools. We integrate with Datadog, New Relic, etc."
- "The difference is we don't just detect - we automatically remediate"
- "Think of GRACE as the layer between detection and resolution"

**Example**: "Most of our customers use PagerDuty or similar tools. The challenge they faced was that those tools are great at alerting, but humans still had to fix the problems. GRACE automates the remediation. We integrate with your existing monitoring to detect issues, then automatically execute the fix - restarting services, scaling resources, rolling back deployments - without waking up an engineer at 3 AM."

---

### Objection 3: "We need to build this ourselves"

**Probe**:
- "What's your timeline to build?"
- "Do you have dedicated team for this?"
- "What's the opportunity cost of engineering time?"

**Response**:
- "Many customers explored building internally. Challenge is ongoing maintenance and evolution"
- "Your engineers should build your core product, not infrastructure tooling"
- "Build vs. buy calculation usually favors buy for non-core capabilities"

**Example**: "I respect that - you have talented engineers. The question is: is incident automation your core competency and competitive advantage? Most of our customers found that building this internally required 3-5 engineers for 12+ months, plus ongoing maintenance. That's $1.5M+ in year one. Meanwhile, their competitors are shipping features. GRACE lets you get this capability in 30 days for a fraction of the cost, and your engineers stay focused on your product."

---

### Objection 4: "We need to see it work in our environment"

**Response**: "Absolutely! That's exactly why we offer a 30-day POC."

**Action**:
- Propose structured POC
- Define clear success criteria
- Get commitment: "If we achieve [X results], what's the next step?"

---

### Objection 5: "The timing isn't right / Need to wait until next year"

**Probe**:
- "What needs to happen between now and then?"
- "What's changing that makes it better timing?"
- "What's the cost of waiting 6 months?"

**Response**:
- Calculate cost of delay: "Based on your current incident rate, delaying costs $X per month"
- Create urgency: "We can start with limited scope now, expand later"
- Offer pilot: "Let's do a pilot now, full rollout next year"

---

## Competitive Battle Cards

### vs. Competitor A (Traditional Monitoring)

**Their Strengths**:
- Established brand
- Broad feature set
- Large customer base

**Their Weaknesses**:
- No self-healing capabilities
- Manual remediation required
- Complex pricing

**Our Advantages**:
- Automated remediation (they only detect)
- Faster time to value
- Better ROI
- Superior governance and compliance

**Positioning**: "While [Competitor A] tells you there's a problem, GRACE fixes it automatically"

**Trap to Set**: Ask about their MTTR. Highlight that detection is only half the battle - remediation is where time is lost.

---

### vs. Competitor B (AIOps Platform)

**Their Strengths**:
- Advanced AI/ML capabilities
- Strong analytics
- Enterprise features

**Their Weaknesses**:
- Expensive (2-3x our pricing)

- Requires dedicated staff
- Over-engineered for most use cases

**Our Advantages**:
- Better price/performance
- Faster deployment (30 days)
- Easier to use
- Better support

**Positioning**: "GRACE delivers 80% of the value at 30% of the cost and time"

**Trap to Set**: Ask about implementation timeline and total cost of ownership
