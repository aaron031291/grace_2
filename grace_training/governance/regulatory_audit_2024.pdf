2. **Strong Access Controls**
   - MFA enforced for all users
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) properly implemented
   - Regular access reviews conducted
   - Privileged access management in place

3. **Data Protection Measures**
   - AES-256 encryption at rest
   - TLS 1.3 for data in transit
   - Encryption key management via HSM
   - Data classification framework implemented

4. **Incident Response**
   - Well-documented incident response procedures
   - Regular tabletop exercises conducted
   - Mean time to detect (MTTD): 8 minutes
   - Mean time to respond (MTTR): 23 minutes

5. **Business Continuity**
   - Comprehensive disaster recovery plan
   - Regular backup testing
   - RTO: 1 hour, RPO: 15 minutes
   - Multi-region deployment capability

### Observations (Minor)

#### Observation 1: Password Rotation Policy
**Finding**: While password complexity requirements are strong, the password rotation policy is set to 90 days. Industry best practice is moving toward eliminating mandatory periodic password changes unless compromise is suspected.

**Risk Level**: Low  
**Recommendation**: Consider revising password policy to remove mandatory rotation unless breach is detected, while maintaining strong complexity requirements and monitoring for compromised credentials.

**Management Response**: Accepted. Will update password policy in Q1 2025 to align with NIST SP 800-63B guidelines.

**Remediation Status**: In Progress  
**Target Completion**: February 28, 2025

#### Observation 2: Vendor Security Assessment Documentation
**Finding**: While vendor security assessments are conducted, documentation of the assessment process could be more standardized. Some vendor files lacked complete security questionnaires.

**Risk Level**: Low  
**Recommendation**: Implement standardized vendor security assessment template and ensure all vendor files contain complete documentation.

**Management Response**: Accepted. Standardized template created and retroactive documentation in progress.

**Remediation Status**: 75% Complete  
**Target Completion**: January 31, 2025

#### Observation 3: Backup Restoration Testing Frequency
**Finding**: Backup restoration testing is performed quarterly. While adequate, monthly testing would provide higher assurance of recovery capability.

**Risk Level**: Low  
**Recommendation**: Increase backup restoration testing frequency to monthly for critical systems.

**Management Response**: Accepted. Will implement monthly automated restoration testing for Tier 1 systems.

**Remediation Status**: Planned  
**Target Completion**: March 15, 2025
