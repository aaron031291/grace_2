## What Makes Grace Special

### 1. Self-Sufficient LLM
Unlike systems dependent on OpenAI/Anthropic:
- Uses her OWN reasoning
- Knowledge from what she learned
- No API costs for generation
- Complete privacy
- Not dependent on external services

### 2. Autonomous with Oversight
Grace can:
- Research continuously ✓
- Learn from new knowledge ✓
- Test improvements safely ✓
- Create proposals ✓

But CANNOT:
- Deploy without approval ✗
- Access unapproved domains ✗
- Execute dangerous commands ✗
- Bypass governance ✗

### 3. Unbreakable Core
- API crashes → Core auto-restarts it
- Kernel crashes → Core auto-restarts it
- Core is minimal and hardened
- Message bus ensures communication
- Immutable log preserves history

### 4. Complete Transparency
- Real-time activity monitor
- Every action logged
- Adaptive reasoning reports
- Daily summary briefs
- Full audit trail

### 5. Human Control
- Emergency stop (ESC)
- Pause/resume
- Final approval power
- Complete visibility
- Kill switch always works

## Grace's Motto

> "I research, I learn, I think, I test, I propose...  
> But YOU decide.  
>   
> I'm autonomous for learning.  
> You're autonomous for approving.  
>   
> Together, we're unstoppable."
