"""Demo: Grace Architect Building Market Intelligence System

This demonstrates the Grace Architect Agent building a complete
market intelligence system with FULL Grace integration:

- Governance checks before API calls
- Hunter scans on ingested data  
- Verification signatures
- Constitutional compliance
- Parliament approval for deployment
- Proper test generation

This is Amp-like, but Grace-aware.
