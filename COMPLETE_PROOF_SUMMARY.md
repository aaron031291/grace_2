## 🚀 To Start Grace & See Everything Live

### Start Command:
```bash
START_GRACE.bat
```

### What Will Happen:
1. Guardian boots first (network, ports, diagnostics)
2. Self-healing orchestrator starts
3. Continuous learning loop activates
4. **Proactive learning agent** starts (learns from internet every 60s)
5. 20 Grace kernels boot
6. Mission Control Hub starts
7. Task registry database initializes

### Then You Can:
```bash
# See Mission Control
curl http://localhost:8000/api/mission-control/status

# View missions
curl http://localhost:8000/api/mission-control/missions

# See unified tasks
python tests/exercise_mission_control.py

# Watch learning in action
# (Proactive learning agent runs automatically every 60s)
```
