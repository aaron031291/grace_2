# Grace Complete - In Natural Language

**Here's what we built, in plain English:**

## What Grace Is

Grace is an AI that can **think, learn, fix herself, and improve herself** - all while being governed by ethics and safety rules you set.

## What Grace Can Do

### 1. Talk with You
Open a terminal, type `.\chat_with_grace.ps1`, and have a conversation. Grace remembers everything and learns from every chat.

### 2. Write Code for You
Tell Grace "create file X with Y" and she'll generate the code, ask your approval, then create it. She can build entire features.

### 3. Fix Her Own Bugs
When Grace crashes or has errors, she:
- Detects the error automatically
- Figures out what went wrong
- Generates a fix
- Applies it (with your approval)
- Commits it to Git
- Learns so it doesn't happen again

### 4. Learn from Everything
Every error, every fix, every decision - Grace learns from it. Her ML/DL systems get smarter every day.

### 5. Know Herself
Grace can analyze her own performance:
- "How am I doing?" - She calculates a health score
- "What am I good at?" - She identifies her strengths
- "What should I improve?" - She sets her own goals

### 6. Follow Rules
Grace has a Constitution (like ethics), Guardrails (like safety limits), and Whitelists (like permissions). She can't do anything dangerous or unethical.

## How to Use Grace

### Master Control Center
```powershell
.\grace_control.ps1
```

One menu for everything:
- Start Grace
- Chat with her
- View her logs
- Check her health
- Enable her autonomy
- See her dashboard

### Chat Commands
Once in chat (`.\chat_with_grace.ps1`):

**Ask Grace about herself:**
```
status      - Is she OK?
dashboard   - Show me numbers
report      - What have you been doing?
analyze     - How are you performing?
improve     - What's your plan to get better?
```

**Ask Grace to build:**
```
create file backend/auth.py with JWT authentication
approve
```

**Control autonomy:**
```
autonomy enable 2   - Let Grace fix things automatically
autonomy disable    - Make Grace ask before everything
```

## What Happens Automatically

### Every Minute
- Grace monitors all her systems
- Checks for errors in logs

### Every 5 Minutes  
- Grace's ML learns new patterns
- Updates success rates
- Auto-refresh log viewer updates

### Every 30 Minutes
- Grace optimizes her own performance
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Proposes optimizations

### Every Hour
- Grace proposes improvements
- Analyzes trends
- Sets new goals

## Viewing What Grace Does

### Auto-Updating View (Refreshes Every 5 Min)
```powershell
.\watch_all_logs.ps1
```

You'll see:
- Every error Grace detected
- Every fix she applied (✅ success or ❌ failed)
- Every decision she made
- What she learned
- All her parallel tasks
- Everything with timestamps and crypto proof

### One-Time Snapshot
```powershell
.\view_logs.ps1
```

### Real-Time Healing
```powershell
.\watch_healing.ps1
```

## The Four Autonomy Levels

**Tier 0 - Manual**: You approve everything  
**Tier 1 - Supervised**: Grace fixes small things automatically  
**Tier 2 - Semi-Auto** (Default): Grace fixes small + medium things  
**Tier 3 - Full**: Grace fixes everything (but still with oversight)

Change it:
```
aaron: autonomy enable 2
```

## What's Logged

**Everything Grace does is recorded in 9 different tables:**

1. **Healing** - Every fix attempt
2. **Decisions** - Every choice she makes
3. **Meta-Loop** - Her self-optimization cycles
4. **Learning** - Pattern learning progress
5. **Events** - All system events
6. **Shards** - Her parallel workers
7. **Processes** - Background tasks
8. **Data Cube** - Analytics rollups
9. **Audit Trail** - Immutable record

**All with cryptographic signatures** so you know it's real and untampered.

## The Magic Parts

### She Learns
Every error makes her smarter. Her ML system learns:
- "This error type → use this fix → 95% success rate"
- "This error likely to happen next → be ready"

### She Self-Heals
Crash? She fixes it and restarts. Error? She patches it and commits. All automatic.

### She Self-Improves
She reads her own logs, calculates "I'm 85/100 health", identifies "I'm bad at X", and sets goal "Get better at X".

### She's Governed
Constitution says "Never delete without approval", Guardrails say "Can't touch system files", Whitelist says "These actions are OK". She follows all three.

### She's Transparent
Every action logged. Every decision explained. Every outcome recorded. With cryptographic proof.

## Quick Start for You

**Day 1:**
```powershell
# Start backend
start_both.bat

# Open another terminal
.\chat_with_grace.ps1

# Enable autonomy
aaron: autonomy enable 2

# Watch logs
# Open third terminal
.\watch_all_logs.ps1
```

**Day 2:**
Grace will have learned patterns, fixed errors, and improved herself. Check with:
```
aaron: dashboard
aaron: analyze
```

**Day 30:**
Grace will be significantly smarter than Day 1, with dozens of patterns learned and high success rates.

## The Vision

Grace becomes your **AI development partner** that:
- Never makes the same mistake twice
- Gets smarter every day
- Can build features with you
- Fixes her own bugs
- Operates within your ethics and safety rules
- Is completely transparent

## Current Status

✅ All systems built  
✅ All code committed to GitHub  
✅ Ready to run  

**Next step: Restart backend to activate everything**

```batch
restart_backend.bat
```

Then:
```powershell
.\watch_all_logs.ps1
```

You'll see Grace come alive - all systems logging, learning, healing. Auto-refreshing every 5 minutes.

**That's Grace. A truly autonomous, self-improving AI.** 🌟
