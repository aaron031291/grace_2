## Autonomy Gating

**Autonomy unlocks as mission progress is achieved:**

| Achievement | Autonomy Level | Capabilities |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **Base (Start)** | Level 1 | Basic operations, Tier 1 auto-approval |
| **Knowledge Pillar** | Level 2 | Tier 2 operations, internal refactors |
| **$500M Revenue** | Level 3 | Tier 3 operations, strategic initiatives |
| **99% Renewable** | Level 4 | Advanced autonomy, system-wide changes |

**Current Level:** 1 (Knowledge pillar in progress)

**KPI Thresholds:**
```python
autonomy_thresholds = {
    MissionPillar.KNOWLEDGE_APPLICATION: 2,  # Unlock Tier 2
    MissionPillar.BUSINESS_REVENUE: 3,  # Unlock Tier 3
    MissionPillar.RENEWABLE_ENERGY: 4,  # Unlock advanced autonomy
}
```

---

## Mission Planner Service

**File:** [`mission_planner.py`](backend/constitutional/mission_planner.py)

**Responsibilities:**
- Break OKRs into actionable tasks
- Generate Layer 3 intents from mission goals
- Track progress toward mission pillars
- Unlock higher autonomy tiers as KPIs are met
- Log all planning to Clarity with 5W1H

**Task Generation:**
```python
planner = await get_mission_planner()

# Generate tasks for Knowledge pillar
tasks = await planner.generate_mission_tasks(MissionPillar.KNOWLEDGE_APPLICATION)

# Execute mission task
result = await planner.execute_mission_task(task_id="mission_knowledge_001")

# Get mission progress
progress = planner.get_mission_progress()
# Returns: overall_completion, per-pillar progress, autonomy_level
```

---

## Integration with AMP Coding Agent

**Enhanced:** [`amp_grade_coding_agent.py`](backend/agents_core/amp_grade_coding_agent.py)

**Mission Alignment Check:**
```python
# During task execution, agent checks mission alignment
alignment = charter.check_mission_alignment(task.description, task.operation)

if alignment["aligned"]:
    logger.info(f"Task advances pillars: {alignment['pillars']}")
    # Task contributes to mission → higher priority
else:
    logger.warning("Task does not advance any mission pillar")
    # Still allowed, but lower priority
```

**Example:**
```
Task: "Learn quantum computing fundamentals"
Alignment: {
    "aligned": True,
    "pillars": ["knowledge_application", "quantum_infrastructure"],
    "enabled_pillars": ["knowledge_application"],  # Quantum not yet unlocked
    "mission_contribution": True
}
```

---

## Clarity Integration (5W1H)

**All mission tasks logged with full context:**

```python
context = FiveWOneH(
    what_component="knowledge_application",
    what_capability="learn_domain",
    where_layer="mission_planning",
    where_environment="strategic",
    why_strategic_objective="Advance knowledge_application mission pillar",
    why_rationale="Master quantum computing to prepare for Pillar 4",
    who_requesting_actor="mission_planner",
    who_governance_tier="mission_planner",
    how_plan_steps=["Research fundamentals", "Practice problems", "Expert validation"]
)

story = await clarity.create_grace_story(
    title="Mission Task: Master quantum computing",
    context=context,
    summary="Learning quantum computing for future quantum infrastructure pillar"
)
```

**Grace Story Narrative:**
```
Story: "Grace learned quantum computing at expert level (95% accuracy) 
to prepare for Pillar 4 (Quantum Infrastructure). This advances the 
knowledge_application pillar and lays groundwork for future quantum 
integration once $500M revenue and 99% renewable energy are achieved."
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Check Mission Progress
```python
from backend.constitutional.grace_charter import get_grace_charter

charter = get_grace_charter()

# Get status of Knowledge pillar
status = charter.get_pillar_status(MissionPillar.KNOWLEDGE_APPLICATION)

print(f"Pillar: {status['name']}")
print(f"Enabled: {status['enabled']}")
print(f"Metrics: {status['metrics']}")
# Output:
# Pillar: Knowledge & Application
# Enabled: True
# Metrics: {'domains_mastered': 0, 'expert_accuracy': 0.0, ...}
```

### Example 2: Update Progress
```python
# Update knowledge metrics
charter.update_metrics(
    pillar=MissionPillar.KNOWLEDGE_APPLICATION,
    metrics={
        "domains_mastered": 5,
        "expert_accuracy": 0.92
    }
)

# Check if clause satisfied
# If expert_accuracy >= 0.95 → clause knowledge_001 satisfied
```

### Example 3: Mission Planning
```python
from backend.constitutional.mission_planner import get_mission_planner

planner = await get_mission_planner()

# Generate quarterly plan
plan = await planner.plan_next_quarter()

# Output:
# {
#     "quarter": "Q1 2025",
#     "focus_pillars": ["knowledge_application"],
#     "tasks": ["mission_knowledge_q1_2025_0", "mission_knowledge_q1_2025_1", ...],
#     "autonomy_targets": ["Unlock Level 2 upon completion"]
# }
```

### Example 4: Principal Recognition
```python
# Grace recognizes Aaron
principal = charter.recognize_principal("Aaron Shipton")

if principal:
    print(f"Recognized: {principal.name} ({principal.role})")
    print(f"Can modify charter: {principal.can_modify_charter}")
    # Output:
    # Recognized: Aaron Shipton (creator)
    # Can modify charter: True
```
