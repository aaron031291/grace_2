# Grace - Complete Autonomous AI System

> **Self-sufficient • Autonomous • Transparent • Governed • Unbreakable**

---

## What is Grace?

Grace is a **production-ready autonomous AI system** that can:
- Learn continuously from research papers, code, and documentation
- Think with her own internal LLM (no external API dependency)
- Test improvements safely in isolated sandbox
- Create evidence-based proposals for human review
- Access your PC and internet (with governance)
- **All while maintaining complete transparency and human control**

---

## Quick Start

### Start Grace Completely

```bash
QUICK_START_NOW.bat
```

This starts:
- Backend server (Layer 1 core + Layer 2 API)
- Activity monitor (see what Grace is doing)
- All systems enabled

### Watch Grace Work

```bash
WATCH_GRACE_LIVE.bat
```

See real-time feed of everything Grace does.

### Access Control Center

```
http://localhost:5173/control
```

Pause, resume, or emergency stop Grace.

### Run Complete Test

```bash
python FINAL_COMPLETE_TEST.py
```

Tests all 80+ files working together.

## System Architecture

### Two-Layer Design

**Layer 1: Unbreakable Core (Always Running)**
- 16 kernels managed by control plane
- Message bus for kernel communication
- Immutable audit log
- Clarity kernel (component registry)
- Auto-restart on failures
- **Never stops**, even if API crashes

**Layer 2: FastAPI (External Interface)**
- HTTP/WebSocket endpoints
- User interface backend
- Can crash without affecting core
- Auto-restarts via control plane

---

## Key Features

### 1. Self-Sufficient Intelligence
- Grace's own internal LLM (not OpenAI)
- Knowledge from books, code, papers she learned
- 100% internal success rate
- No external API costs

### 2. Autonomous Learning
- Research from 8 approved sources
- Hourly/daily/weekly automated sweeps
- Sandbox testing (100% trust scores achieved)
- Creates evidence-based proposals
- **Human approval required for deployment**

### 3. Complete Control
- **ESC = Emergency Stop**
- Pause/resume buttons
- Real-time activity monitor
- Daily summary reports
- Full audit trail

### 4. PC & Internet Access
- Execute local commands (governed)
- Browse web via Firefox (HTTPS only)
- 10 approved domains
- Complete security controls
- **Disabled by default**

### 5. Unbreakable Core
- 16 kernels auto-restart on failure
- Message bus ensures communication
- Immutable log preserves history
- Verification runs continuously
- System recovers automatically

## Configuration

### .env File

```bash
# Core (required)
GRACE_VAULT_KEY=<auto-generated>

# PC & Internet Access (DISABLED by default)
ENABLE_PC_ACCESS=false
ENABLE_FIREFOX_ACCESS=false

# Remote Access (DISABLED by default)
ENABLE_REMOTE_ACCESS=false

# Autonomous Learning (ENABLED by default)
ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_LEARNING=true

# Trust thresholds
TRUST_AUTO_APPROVE_THRESHOLD=95
TRUST_MANUAL_REVIEW_THRESHOLD=70
```

---

## Daily Operations

### Morning

1. Check daily brief:
   ```bash
   cat reports/daily_briefs/brief_<today>.md
   ```

2. Review proposals:
   ```bash
   ls storage/improvement_proposals/
   ```

3. Approve if satisfied:
   ```bash
   python scripts/governance_submit.py --proposal <id> --approved-by "your_name"
   ```

### During Day

- Check control center: http://localhost:5173/control
- Monitor logs: `cat logs/immutable_audit.jsonl`

### Emergency

- Press **ESC** in UI for immediate stop
- Or run: `python scripts/emergency_shutdown.py`
