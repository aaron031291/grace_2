## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Open Visual Log
```bash
view_ingestion_log.bat
```

### 2. Chat with Grace
```bash
grace_terminal.bat

You: learn react
You: youtube docker
You: reddit kubernetes
You: status
```

### 3. Check API Docs
Open browser: http://localhost:8000/docs

**New endpoints**:
- `/web-learning/*` - 40+ learning endpoints
- `/web-learning/amp/*` - Amp API (last resort + verification)
- `/web-learning/verify/*` - Verification & ML
- `/web-learning/ingestions/*` - Visual logs

### 4. Monitor Ingestions
Watch Grace learn in real-time:
```bash
watch_ingestion.bat
```

---

## 💬 Try These Commands

```bash
# In grace_terminal.bat

You: learn python async
  → Grace tries web sources
  → Queues for Amp verification
  → ML learns domain reliability

You: learn react hooks
  → If reactjs.org verified before
  → ML skips verification (cost saved!)

You: reddit microservices
  → Learns from community
  → Verifies if software engineering topic

You: status
  → See all statistics

You: stop remote
  → Stop computer access
```

## 📊 What's Happening

### On Startup
```
[WEB-LEARNING] 🌐 Starting Web Learning Systems...
[WEB-LEARNING] ✅ Web Learning Systems online
[WEB-LEARNING]   • Web Scraper (83+ trusted domains)
[WEB-LEARNING]   • GitHub Miner
[WEB-LEARNING]   • YouTube Learning
[WEB-LEARNING]   • Reddit Learning (38+ subreddits)
[WEB-LEARNING]   • API Discovery & Integration
[WEB-LEARNING]   • Remote Computer Access
[WEB-LEARNING]   • Amp API (Last Resort - Batch Querying)
[WEB-LEARNING]   • Visual Ingestion Logs (with clickable links)

```

### When Grace Learns
```
1. Ingests from free source
2. Stores with provenance (clickable link!)
3. ML checks: "Should verify?"
4. If yes → Queues for Amp verification
5. Batch processes (cost-effective)
6. Amp confirms accuracy
7. Trust score updated
8. ML learns reliability
9. Future: Skips verification if trusted!
```

## 🔗 Clickable Links

Every source Grace learns from has:
- **HTTP link** in visual log
- **Ctrl+Click** in terminal
- **Click in browser** to view source
- **Complete provenance** trace

---

## 🎉 Grace is Ready!

**What to do now**:
1. ✅ Backend running (http://localhost:8000)
2. ✅ Open visual log (`view_ingestion_log.bat`)
3. ✅ Chat with Grace (`grace_terminal.bat`)
4. ✅ Watch her learn and verify sources!

**Grace is fully autonomous with Amp verification and ML learning! 🧠💎✨**
