## 💎 Amp API Dual Purpose

### Purpose 1: Last Resort Learning
When ALL free sources fail:
```
Web ❌ → GitHub ❌ → YouTube ❌ → Reddit ❌
  ↓
Amp API ✅ (batched for savings)
```

### Purpose 2: Verification
Validates free source accuracy:
```
Free Source → Ingest → Amp Verifies → ML Learns
```

**Cost-effective**: Batching + ML-guided sampling

---

## 🧠 How ML/DL Learns

### Phase 1: Initial Learning (Days 1-7)
```
- Verify most sources with Amp
- Build reliability database
- Learn domain strengths/weaknesses
- Cost: ~$0.50-1.00
```

### Phase 2: Smart Sampling (Weeks 2-4)
```
- Highly reliable domains → Skip verification
- Unknown domains → Verify
- Medium domains → Sample 20%
- Cost: ~$0.10-0.20/week
```

### Phase 3: Autonomous (Month 2+)
```
- 95%+ sources don't need verification
- ML model predicts reliability
- Only verify new/suspicious sources
- Cost: ~$0.05/week
```

**ML/DL pays for itself quickly!**

## 📊 Database Schema

### Knowledge Sources
```sql
knowledge_sources (existing)
  + trust_score (updated by verification)
  + verified (boolean)
```

### Verified Sources
```sql
verified_sources (new)
  - source_id
  - accuracy_score
  - verification_response
  - trust_boost
```

### ML Reliability Model
```sql
source_reliability_model (new)
  - domain
  - reliability_score (learned)
  - strong_topics (ML-learned)
  - weak_topics (ML-learned)
  - predicted_accuracy (ML prediction)
  - recommend_for_topics (ML recommendation)
```

### Amp Queries
```sql
amp_queries (existing)
