## How It All Works

### When You Ask Grace to Learn

**Example**: `You: learn advanced kubernetes`

```
Step 1: Grace tries Web
  → Searches 83+ domains
  → ❌ No good results

Step 2: Grace tries GitHub
  → Mines k8s repositories
  → ❌ No new patterns

Step 3: Grace tries YouTube
  → Searches for tutorials
  → ❌ No advanced content

Step 4: Grace tries Reddit
  → Checks r/kubernetes, r/devops
  → ❌ No recent discussions

Step 5: Grace uses Amp API (last resort!)
  → Adds to batch queue
  → Waits 5 mins for more questions
  → Batches 5 questions together
  → Sends one query (saves $0.04!)
  → ✅ Gets answer

All logged with:
  ✅ Clickable link to Amp
  ✅ Crypto signature
  ✅ Cost tracking ($0.01)
  ✅ Sources tried (web, github, youtube, reddit)
  ✅ Full provenance
```
